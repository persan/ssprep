--  This procedure implements the template for the top-level driver of an
--  ASIS application. This driver processes all the Compilation Units which
--  are located in a given ASIS Context. By default, the Context is made up
--  by all the tree files contained in the current directory.
--
--  The driver does not have parameter.
--
--  When working, this driver generates the trace containg the names of
--  compilation units being processed.
