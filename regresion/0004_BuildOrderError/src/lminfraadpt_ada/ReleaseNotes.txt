Release note for view:  lminfraadpt/.../lminfraadpt_ada
======================

Changes since latest release:
==============================
Release: 0.4.0  2010-06-16 /lsen

This release requires lminfraadpt_cpp 0.4.0 or later

1)
Added a procedure. This uses IDL "ControlInterfaceStateResponse"

   Procedure Send_Interface_State_Response
     (InterfaceName        : in String;
      Accepted             : in Boolean;
      RequestId            : in Long_Long_Integer;
      RequestingInstanceId : in String);

Note: There is an old version with a similar name that uses IDL "InterfaceState"
      It is still present but will be removed in a future release.

   Procedure Send_InterfaceState_Response
     (InterfaceName        : in String;
      Accepted             : in Boolean;
      Enabled              : in Boolean;
      RequestId            : in Long_Long_Integer;
      RequestingInstanceId : in String);

2) Updated test program to test the new procedure

Note: A line corresponding to this must be added to LmInfraAdpt.xml
    <qos_profile name ="ControlInterfaceStateResponse"
                 base_name="SaabGroup9LvLMInfrastructure::DefaultProfile"/>

TODO in a future release
1)
Remove code for IDL "SoftwareComponentStatus",  "AdaptedComponentStatus"
since they are only used by ERHA which uses own implementations.

2) Remove Procedure Send_InterfaceState_Response

=========================================================================
Release: 0.3.0  2010-06-11 /lsen

Removed BuiltInTests functions

Note that BuiltInTests functions are also removed in lminfraadpt_cpp 0.3.0
so when the new lminfraadpt_cpp 0.3.0 is used, previous versions of 
lminfraadpt_ada will not compile.

=========================================================================

Release: 0.2.3  2010-03-22 /jath
1) Corrected two errors

Release: 0.2.2  2010-03-22 /jath
1) Changed buffer handling, now only 1 buffer per message.
2) Data is to be processed during rendezvous, enabling return values.
3) The Service sends initial status on some of the interfaces.
4) More comments on how to use the service package

Release: 0.2.1  2010-03-04 /jath
1) Updated for changes in lminfraadpt_cpp 0.2.2
2) Removed one operation that is to be used by EVHA only 
3) Updated test code
4) More comments on how to use the service package

Release: 0.1.6  2010-03-01 /jath
1) Added package lminfraadpt.service

Release: 0.1.5  2010-02-23 /jath
1) tests/lminfraadpt_ada_test.gpr
   Added "-ld" to liker switches. Without this we get:
   libnddscore.so: unsolved ref dlopen,dlclose,dlerror,dlsym
2) Made the Ada code more Ada-like.
   Uses Ada.Strings.Unbounded for out parameters with variable length
   Uses procedures that may raise an exception instead of functions with return codes.
   Moved mapping of Ada-enumerations to C++-enum to the bodies, this enables
   the mappings to change without recompiling code that uses the specs.

Release: 0.1.4   2010-02-17 /lsen
1) File private/lminfraadpt-builtintest.adb
   Added "& Ascii.NUL" to some String parameters passed to C-code.
   The C-code didn't like 'Not NULL terminiated' strings.
